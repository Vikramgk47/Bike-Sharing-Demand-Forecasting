## 🚲 Bike Sharing Demand Forecasting

This project uses **JMP** and **MS Excel** to forecast hourly bike rental demand from a dataset with over 17,000 hourly records. The goal is to uncover usage patterns, build accurate prediction models, and suggest operational improvements for bike-sharing systems.

---

## 📊 Objective

- Forecast hourly demand for bike rentals based on weather, seasonality, and user types.
- Provide insights into user behavior (casual vs. registered).
- Recommend strategies for real-time rebalancing and customer satisfaction.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **JMP**: Predictive modeling, evaluation, and visualization.
- **MS Excel**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis.

---

## 🔍 Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned data, created new features (e.g., peak hours, working days).
- **Feature Engineering**: Engineered time-based and weather-related variables to improve prediction.
- **Modeling Techniques**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Boosted Tree
  - Neural Networks
  - Bootstrap Forest

### ✅ Best Performing Model
- **Model Selected**: Bootstrap Forest
- **R² (Validation)**: 0.781
- Reason: Best balance between accuracy and generalization.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Casual users** peak during weekends and good weather.
- **Registered users** follow commuting patterns (weekday mornings/evenings).
- High humidity and low temperature reduce overall usage.
- Predictive insights can help with:
  - **Bike rebalancing**
  - **Inventory planning**
  - **Targeted marketing**
